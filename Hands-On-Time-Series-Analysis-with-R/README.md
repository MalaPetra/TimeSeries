**Perform time series analysis and forecasting using R**

## What is this book about?
Time series analysis is the art of extracting meaningful insights from, and revealing patterns in, time series data using statistical and data visualization approaches. These insights and patterns can then be utilized to explore past events and forecast future values in the series.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Visualize time series data and derive better insights
* Explore auto-correlation and master statistical techniques
* Use time series analysis tools from the stats, TSstudio, and forecast packages
* Explore and identify seasonal and correlation patterns
* Work with different time series formats in R
* Explore time series models such as ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and more
* Evaluate high-performance forecasting solutions
